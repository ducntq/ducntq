## 2024 goals

- [ ] Buy a plot of land: Ongoing. I put the down payment for 1700 sqm plot of land, 220km away from my apartment.
- [ ] Learn more about 3D modeling: Ongoing.
- [ ] Learn more about agriculture: Planned.
- [ ] Finish building the Atomic U300 3D printer: Ongoing. I've been using the [Cairo 3D Printer](https://makesomestuff.org/cairo-3d-printer/) for awhile. It was a great starter machine for newbie like me. But over the course of 2023, I've learnt a lot about 3D printing, and it's come to a point where I'm comfortable building a new & more advanced machine.
- [ ] Build my [Mosquito](https://github.com/HYBRIDAIRSOFT/MOSQUITO) airsoft: Delayed.
- [ ] Build a 3D printed RC FPV airplane: Planned.
- [ ] Start 2nd business: Planning.

Phew, that's a lot for 2024.
